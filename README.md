This Python script showcases a text generation model employing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. Trained on Shakespearean text, the model generates new text by learning patterns from the input. The script allows users to control the creativity of the generated text by adjusting the temperature parameter during the generation process. The pre-trained model can be loaded for immediate use, and the provided code includes examples of generating text with different temperature settings.
